    \section{引言}
    GRACE Follow-On双星计划作为GRACE卫星计划的延续，开创性采用了星载激光干涉仪测量星间距与星间变率。
    星载激光干涉测距仪由美德两国联合研制，成功地证明了两相距甚远的航天器间实现激光干涉测距的可行性，并将推动空间重力探测任务进入下一个精度水平。

    \section{星载双单程测距系统}
    GRACE Follow-On采用了双单程K波段测距系统来进行精确星间相位测量,其精度达到$10^{-4}$周期\cite{kornfeldGRACEFOGravityRecovery2019}。该系统通过组合双星的相位测量值来抵消USO(ultra-stable oscillator，超稳振荡器)不稳定性的影响。通过以上过程就能得出LLSST(low-low satellite-to-satellite tracking，低低卫卫跟踪测量)测量的两个最重要观测量——星间距(range)和星间变率(range-rate)。
    \noindent Equations: 
    \begin{equation}
        E=mc^2
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}
        H\psi=E\psi
    \end{equation}\\
    $\partial\partial=0$, and
    $$\iint_S \vec{F}\cdot \vec{n}d\sigma=\iiint \nabla\times\vec{F}dV$$
